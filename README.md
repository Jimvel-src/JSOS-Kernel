# JSOS-Kernel
The open-source kernel  / core of the Simple OS project. This is a community-developed project.

## Devolopment
*We are envisioning an JS script which will hold all the technical things and also everything so that the html code will be very easy to devolop.
*CSS script which will hold all the layouts and styles of the project.
